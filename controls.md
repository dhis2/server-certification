# DHIS2 Server Certification Controls

This document contains the list of controls for a system claiming compliance to the DSCP.
Each control is listed together with

- a control identifier
- mapping to CIS control
- a name
- a description/justification
- requirement/evidence for compliance
- ranking

Controls may be organisational or technical.  Organisational controls are informative and will be
part of the final report.  Technical controls are normative and compliance to them will determine
whether a certificate is awarded or not.
